BTF is a lightweight desktop application built with Electron that helps EVE Online players quickly browse, view, and copy recommended ship fits for various Burners NPC factions. 
The app features a clean, dark-themed interface with a custom title bar, a responsive sidebar for NPC selection, and a convenient “Copy” button integrated directly in the fit panel.
